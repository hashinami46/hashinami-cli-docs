## üöÄ Description
‚ö° Improved version of sakamichi-app-ts-cli. A cli tool to download various assets from Sakamichi Apps and Games.
It's still under development and I'll add some features to download assets from other apps later.

- Automatic sorting and organizing downloaded assets.
- Support for multiple apps with future updates.
- Multiple language support.

## üì∏ Sample

  <source src={require("@site/static/vid/sample-vid-01.mp4").default} type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## ü™µ Changelog

```
